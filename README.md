- 👋 Hi, I’m @SofiaAlmroth
- 👀 I’m interested in  building creative, user-friendly web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js and GSAP to level up my frontend skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web projects that push boundaries and deliver great user experiences.
- 📫 How to reach me almrothsofia@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, I’m probably sewing, gardening, or enjoying good food and wine—though I’ve learned coding and wine don’t mix (trust me, I tried)!
